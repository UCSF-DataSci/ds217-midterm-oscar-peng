2. Intervention Group Comparison:
                    CVD Rate (%)  Mean Adherence (%)  Dropout Rate (%)
intervention_group                                                    
control                33.297721           60.954772         15.669516
treatment a            31.931236           60.321873         14.923189
treatment b            33.560660           61.136037         14.070352

3. Observations:
- From site A to site E, the count of patients decreases. Their mean age and BMI remained consistent.
- The mean adherence and dropout rates stayed very consistent across intervention groups.
- There was no significant difference in CVD rates across intervention groups.
